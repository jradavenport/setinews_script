# setinews_script
scripts to automate the creation of the SETI.news emails and website

things we might need:

- ADS API to pull latest articles?
- Mailchimp API (KEEP KEYS OUT OF REPO) to send newsletter, get link
- simple text scripts to generate the monthly blog post
- simple script to run jekyll and git
- all this orchestrated by a single Python script?
